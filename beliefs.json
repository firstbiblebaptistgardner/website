  ["The Holy Scriptures",
    "We believe the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testament to be the verbally and plenarily inspired Word of God.  The Scriptures are inerrant, infallible, and God-breathed and, therefore, are the final authority for faith and life.  The sixty-six books of the Old and New Testament are the complete and divine revelation of God to Man.  The Scriptures shall be interpreted according to their normal grammatical-historical meaning, and all issues of interpretation and meaning shall be determined by the pastor.  The King James Version of the Bible shall be the official and only translation used by the church. [2 Tim 3:16-17][2 Pe 1:20-21]"],
  ["Dispensationalism", 
    "We believe that the Scriptures interpreted in their natural, literal sense reveal divinely determined dispensations or rules of life which define man’s responsibilities in successive ages.  These dispensations are not ways of salvation, but rather are divinely ordered stewardships by which God directs man according to His purpose.  Three of these dispensations – the law, the church, and the kingdom – are the subjects of detailed revelation in Scripture. [Gen 1:28][1 Cor. 9:17][2 Cor 3:9-18] [Gal 3:13-25][Eph 1:10][Eph 3:2-10][Col 1:24-25,27][Rev 20:2-6]"],
  ["The Godhead",
    "We believe in one triune God, eternally existing in three persons – Father, Son, and Holy Spirit – each co-eternal in being, co-identical in nature, co-equal in power and glory, and having the same attributes and perfections.  [Deut. 6:4][Matt 28:19][John 14:10][John 14:26][2 Cor 13:14]"],
  ["God the Father",
  "We believe that God, the Father, is perfectly holy, omniscient, and omnipotent, and concerns himself mercifully in the affairs of men, hears and answers prayer, and saves from hell all those who come to Him through Jesus Christ in simple faith and repentance."],
  ["The Person and Work of Christ",
    ["We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God, became man, without ceasing to be God, having been conceived by the Holy Ghost and born of the Virgin Mary, in order that He might reveal God and redeem sinful men.  [Isaiah 7:14][Isaiah 9:6][Luke 1:35][John 1:1-2][John 1:14][2 Cor. 5:19-21][Gal 4:4-5](Phil 2:5-8)",
    "We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ accomplished our redemption through His death on the cross as a representative, vicarious, substitutionary sacrifice, and that our justification is made sure by His literal, physical resurrection from the dead.  [Acts 2:18-36][Rom. 3:24-25][Eph 1:7][1 Pet. 2:24][1 Pet. 1:3-5]",
    "We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ ascended to Heaven and is now exalted at the right hand of God where, as our High Priest, He fulfills the ministry of Representative, Intercessor, and Advocate.  [Acts 1:9-10][Rom. 8:34][Heb 9:24][Heb 7:25][1 John 2:1-2]"]],
  ["The Person and Work of the Holy Spirit",
    ["We believe that the Holy Spirit is a person who convicts the world of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment; and, that He is the Supernatural Agent in regeneration, baptizing all believers into the Body of Christ, indwelling and sealing them unto the day of redemption.  [John 16:8-11] [Rom 8:9] [1 Cor. 12:12-14] [2 Cor. 3:6] [Eph. 1:13-14]",
      "We believe that He is the divine Teacher who assists believers to understand and appropriate the Scriptures and that it is the privilege and duty of all the saved to be filled with the Spirit.  [Eph. 1:17-18] [Eph. 5:18] [1 John 2:20] [1 John 2:27]",
      "We believe that God is soverign in the bestowal of spiritual gifts to every believer.  God uniquely uses evangelists, pastors, and teachers to equip believers in the assembly in order that they can do the work of the ministry.  [Rom. 12:3-8] [1 Cor. 12:4-11] [1 Cor. 12:28] [Eph. 4:7-12]",
      "We believe that the sign gifts of the Holy Spirit, such as speaking in tongues and the gift of healing, were temporary.  Speaking in tongues was never the common or necessary sign of the baptism or filling of the Holy Spirit.  Ultimate deliverance of the body from sickness or death awaits the consummation of our salvation in the resurrection, though God frequently chooses to answer prayers of believers for physical healing.  [1 Cor. 1:22] [1 Cor. 13:8] [1 Cor 14:21-22]"]],
  ["The Total Depravity of Man",
    "We believe that man was created in the image and likeness of God; but that in Adam’s sin the human race fell, inherited a sinful nature, and became alienated from God.  Man is totally depraved and, of himself, utterly unable to remedy his lost condition. [Gen. 1:26-27] [Rom 3:22-23] [Rom 5:12] [Rom 6:23] [Eph. 2:1-3] [Eph 4:17-19]"],
  ["Doctrine of Sin",
    "We believe that sin is the transgression of the law of God.  We believe in the universality of sin: that it separates man from God; that there is no remission of sin apart from the shed blood of Jesus Christ the Son of God and man’s repentance, and acceptance of Jesus Christ by faith"],
  ["Salvation",
    ["We believe that salvation is a gift of God brought to man by grace and received by personal faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, whose precious blood was shed on Calvary for the forgiveness of our sins.  We believe that all sins, except blasphemy of the Holy Spirit, are forgivable. [Matt. 12:31-32] [John 1:12] [Eph. 1:7] [Eph 2:8-10] [1 Pet. 1:18-19] [1 John 1:9]",
    "Regeneration  We believe that in order to be saved, sinners must be born again; that the new birth is not a process; that in the new birth through the Holy Spirit the one dead in trespasses and in sins is made partaker of the divine nature and receives eternal life, the free gift of God: that its proper evidence appears in the holy fruits of repentance and newness of life.",
    "Justification  We believe that justification is the judicial act of God whereby He declares us to be righteous through faith in Christ Jesus; that justification includes the pardon of sin and the imputation of God’s righteousness; that it is bestowed, not by any work which we have done, but solely through faith in the Redeemer’s blood sacrifice.",
    "Sanctification  We believe that sanctification is an act, performed at the new birth, and a process whereby God sets apart all believers unto holiness.  He then conforms them to the image of Christ, completing the process of sanctification at the return of Christ for his saints.",
    "Two Natures  We believe that man is born with a sinful nature and at the time of his new birth he receives a spiritual nature.  These two natures are in constant conflict within the believer.  The new nature will be victorious when we yield to the leading of the Holy Spirit in our lives.",
    "Glorification  We believe that when Christ comes for the church, all believers will be changed at the twinkling of an eye and will become like Christ at His appearing, that our corruptible bodies will become incorruptible, and our mortal bodies made immortal."]],
    ["The Eternal Security and Assurance of Believers",
      ["We believe that all the redeemed, once saved, are kept by God’s power and are thus secure in Christ forever.  [John 6:37-40] [John 10:27-30] [Rom 8:1] [Rom 8:38-39] [1 Cor. 1:4-8] [1 Pet. 1:4-5]",
        "We believe that it is the privilege of believers to rejoice in the assurance of their salvation through the testimony of God’s Word, which, however, clearly forbids the use of Christian liberty as an occasion to the flesh.  [Rom. 13:13-14] [Gal 5:13] [Titus 2:11-15]"]],
    ["The Church",[
        "We believe that the local church, which is the body and the espoused bride of Christ, is solely made up of born-again persons. [1 Cor. 12:12-14] [2 Cor. 11:2] [Eph. 1:22-23] [Eph. 5:25-27]",
        "We believe that the establishment and continuance of local churches is clearly taught and defined in the New Testament Scriptures.  [Acts 14:27] [Acts 20:17] [Acts 20:28-32] [1 Tim. 3:1-13] [Titus 1:5-11]",
        "We believe in the autonomy of the local church free of any external authority or control.  [Acts 13:1-4] [Acts 15:19-31] [Acts 20:28] [Rom. 16:1] [Rom. 16:4]; [1 Cor. 3:9], [1 Cor. 3:16] [1 Cor. 5:4-7] [1 Cor. 5:13] [1 Pet. 5:1-4]",
        "We recognize water baptism and the Lord’s Supper as the Scriptural ordinances of obedience for the church in this age. [Matt. 28:19-20] [Acts 2:41-42] [Acts 8:36-38] [I Cor. 11:23-26]"]],
    ["Separation",
      "We believe that all the saved should live in such a manner as not to bring reproach upon their Savior and Lord.  God commands His people to separate from all religious apostasy, all worldly and sinful pleasures, practices, and associations, and to refrain from all immodest and immoderate appearances, piercings, and bodily markings. [Lev. 19:28] [Rom. 12:1-2] [Rom. 14:13] [1 Cor. 6:19-20] [2 Cor. 6:14-7:1] [2 Tim. 3:1-5] [1 John 2:15-17] [2 John 1:9-11]"],
    ["The Second Coming of Christ",
      "We believe in that blessed hope, the personal, imminent return of Christ, who will rapture His church prior to the seven-year tribulation period.  At the end of the Tribulation, Christ will personally and visibly return with His saints, to establish His earthly Messianic Kingdom which was promised to the nation of Israel. [Ps. 89:3-4], [Dan. 2:31-45] [Zech. 14:4-11] [1 Thess. 1:10] [1 Thess. 4:13-18] [Titus 2:13] [Rev. 3:10] [Rev 19:11-16] [Rev. 20:1-6]"],
    ["The Eternal State",
      ["We believe in the bodily resurrection of all men, the saved to eternal life, and the unsaved to judgment and everlasting punishment.  [Matt. 25:46] [John 5:28-29] [John 11:25-26] [Rev. 20:5-6] [Rev 20:12-13]",
        "We believe that the souls of the redeemed are, at death, absent from the body and present with the Lord, where in conscious bliss they await the first resurrection, when spirit, soul, and body are reunited to be glorified forever with the Lord.  [Luke 23:43] [2 Cor. 5:8] (Phil. 1:23) (Phil. 3:21) [1 Thess. 4:16-17] [Rev. 20:4-6]",
        "We believe that the souls of unbelievers remain, after death, in conscious punishment and torment until the second resurrection, when with soul and body reunited, they shall appear at the Great White Throne judgment, and shall be cast into the Lake of Fire, not to be annihilated, but to suffer everlasting conscious punishment and torment.  [Matt. 25:41-46][Mark 9:43-48] [Luke 16:19-26] [2 Thess. 1:7-9] [Jude 1:6-7] [Rev. 20:11-15]"]],
    ["The Personality of Satan",
      "We believe that Satan is a person, the author of sin and the cause of the Fall of Man;  that he is the open and declared enemy of God and man; and that he shall be eternally punished in the Lake of Fire. [Job 1:6-7] [Isaiah 14:12-17] [Matt. 4:2-11] [Matt. 25:41] [Rev. 20:10]"],
    ["Doctrine of Spirit Beings",
      "We believe that angels and demons are spirit beings.  Angels were created as heavenly hosts, but some, through choice, are now the hosts of Satan and  will share in his ultimate doom.  The angels of heaven, ministering spirits, are sinless and pure and are forever seeking to praise God in their ministries for Him and His people.  Their ministries, ranks, and orders differ, and their strength, appearance, travel, etc. are not bound by natural physical or human laws.  They are immortal and do not marry.  Their abode is heaven."],
    ["Doctrine of Future Events",
      "We believe that God has disclosed the general order of future events in His Word.  We believe that sin will wax worse until the imminent return of Christ for His saints.  This will be followed by a seven  year period of tribulation upon the earth with the judgment seat of Christ and the marriage feast of the Lamb of the Lord and His church taking place in heaven.  Then the Lord will return to earth with His saints to put down the forces of evil and to cast Satan bound into the bottomless pit for a thousand years.  The Lord will at that time set up His millennial kingdom of righteousness on earth.  We believe that at the conclusion of this period, Satan will be loosed for a short while and deceive the hearts of many.  The Lord will then bring forth the final and everlasting judgment for Satan and the wicked.  The righteous will enter their eternal state of bliss."], 
    ["Creation",
      "We believe that God created the universe in six literal, 24 hour periods.  We reject evolution, the Gap Theory, the Day-Age Theory, and Theistic Evolution as unscriptural theories of origin.  [Gen 1:2] [Ex. 20:11]"],
    ["Civil Government",
      "We believe that God has ordained and created all authority consisting of three basic institutions:  1) the home, 2) the church and 3) the state.  Every person is subject to these authorities, but all (including the authorities themselves) are answerable to God and governed by His Word.  God has given each institution specific Biblical responsibilities and balanced those responsibilities with the understanding that no institution has the right to infringe upon the other.  The home, the church, and the state are equal and sovereign in their respective Biblically assigned spheres of responsibility under God.  We believe that we must obey the state unless it requires us to act contrary to our faith at which time we must obey God rather than the state. [Matt. 22:15-22] [Acts 5:29] [Rom 13:1-7] [Eph. 5:22-24] [Titus 3:1-2] [Heb. 13:17] [1 Pet. 2:13-14]"],
    ["Human Sexuality",
      ["We believe that God has commanded that no intimate sexual activity be engaged in outside of marriage between one naturally-born man and one naturally-born woman.  We believe that any form of homosexuality, lesbianism, bisexuality, bestiality, incest, fornication, adultery, and pornography are sinful perversions of God’s gift of sex.  We believe that God disapproves of and forbids any attempt to alter one’s gender by surgery or appearance.  [Gen. 2:24] [Gen. 19:5] [Gen. 9:13] [Gen. 26:8-9] [Lev. 18:1-30] [Rom. 1:26-29] [1 Cor. 5:1] [1 Cor. 6:9] [1 Thess. 4:1-8] [Heb. 13:4]",
        "We believe that the only Scriptural marriage is the joining of one naturally-born man and one naturally-born woman for life.  [Gen 2:24] [Rom 7:2] [1 Cor. 7:10] [Eph. 5:22-23]"]],
    ["Family Relationships",
      ["We believe that men and women are spiritually equal in position before God but that God has ordained distinct and separate spiritual functions for men and women in the home and the church.  The husband is to be the leader of the home, and men are to be the leaders (pastors and deacons) of the church.  Accordingly, only men are eligible for licensure and ordination by the church. [Gal. 3:28] [Col 3:18] [1 Tim. 2:8-15] [1 Tim. 3:4-5] [1 Tim. 3:12]",
        "We believe that God has ordained the family as the foundational institution of human society. The husband is to love his wife as Christ loves the church.  The wife is to submit herself to the Scriptural leadership of her husband as the church submits to the headship of Christ.  Children are an heritage from the Lord.  Parents are responsible for teaching their children spiritual and moral values and leading them, through consistent lifestyle example and appropriate discipline, including Scriptural corporal correction.  [Gen. 1:26-28] [Ex. 20:12] [Deut. 6:4-9] [Ps. 127:3-5] [Prov. 19:18] [Prov. 22:15] [Prov. 23:13-14] [Mk. 10:6-12] [1 Cor. 7:1-16] [Eph. 5:21-33] [Eph. 6:1-4] [Col. 3:18-21] [Heb. 13:4] [1 Pet. 3:1-7]"]],
    ["Divorce and Remarriage",
      "We believe that God disapproves of and forbids divorce and intends marriage to last until one of the spouses dies.  Divorce and remarriage is regarded as adultery except on the grounds of fornication.  Although divorced and remarried persons or divorced persons may hold positions of service in the church and be greatly used of God for Christian service, they may not be considered for the offices of pastor or deacon. [Mal. 2:14-17] [Matt. 19:3-12] [Rom. 7:1-3] [1 Tim. 3:2] [1 Tim 3:12] [Titus 1:6]"],
    ["Abortion",
      "We believe that human life begins at conception and that the unborn child is a living human being.  Abortion constitutes the unjustified, unexcused taking of unborn human life. Abortion is murder.  We reject any teaching that abortions of pregnancies due to rape, incest, birth defects, gender selection, birth or population control, or the physical or mental well being of the mother are acceptable.  [Job 3:16] [Ps. 51:5][Ps 139:14-16] [Isaiah 44:24] [Isaiah 49:1] [Jer. 1:5] [Jer 20:15-18] [Luke 1:44]"],
    ["Euthanasia",
      "We believe that the direct taking of an innocent human life is a moral evil, regardless of the intention.  Life is a gift of God and must be respected from conception until natural death.  Thus we believe that an act or omission which, of itself or by intention, causes death in order to eliminate suffering constitutes a murder contrary to the will of God. Discontinuing medical procedures that are extraordinary or disproportionate to the expected outcome can be a legitimate refusal of over-zealous treatment.  [Ex. 20:13] [Ex. 23:7] [Matt. 5:21] [Acts 17:28]"],
    ["Love",
      "We believe that we should demonstrate love for others, not only toward fellow believers, but also toward both those who are not believers, those who oppose us, and those who engage in sinful actions.  We are to deal with those who oppose us graciously, gently, patiently, and humbly.  God forbids the stirring up of strife, the taking of revenge, or the threat or the use of violence as a means of resolving personal conflict or obtaining personal justice.  Although God commands us to abhor sinful actions, we are to love and pray for any person who engages in such sinful actions. [Lev. 19:18] [Matt. 5:44-48] [Luke 6:31] [John 13:34-35] [Rom. 12:9-10] [Rom. 12:17-21] [Rom. 13:8-10] (Phil 2:2-4) [2 Tim. 2:24-26] [Titus 3:2] [1 John 3:17-18]"],
    ["Lawsuits Between Believers",
      "We believe that Christians are prohibited from bringing civil lawsuits against other Christians or the church to resolve personal disputes.  We believe the Church possesses all the resources necessary to resolve personal disputes between members.  We do believe, however, that a Christian may seek compensation for injuries from another Christian’s insurance company as long as the claim is pursued without malice or slander.  [1 Cor. 6:1-8] [Eph 4:31-32] [Matt 18:15-17]"],  
    ["Missions",
      "We believe that God has given the church a great commission to proclaim the Gospel to all nations so that there might be a great multitude from every nation, tribe, ethnic group, and language group who believe on the Lord Jesus Christ.  As ambassadors of Christ, we must use all available means to go to the foreign nations and not wait for them to come to us. [Matt 28:19-20] [Mark 16:15] [Luke 24:46-48] [John 20:21] [Acts 1:8] [2 Cor. 5:20]"],
    ["Giving", 
      "We believe that every Christian, as a steward of that portion of God’s wealth entrusted to him, is obligated to financially support his local church.  We believe that God has established the tithe as a basis for giving, but that every Christian should also give other offerings sacrificially and cheerfully to the support of the church, the relief of those in need, and spread of the Gospel.  We believe that a Christian relinquishes all rights to direct the use of his tithe or offering once the gift has been made.  [Gen. 14:20] [Prov. 3:9-10] [Acts 4:34-37] [1 Cor. 16:2] [2 Cor. 9:6-7] [Gal. 6:6] [Eph. 4:38] [1 Tim. 5:17-18] [1 John 3:17]"]
